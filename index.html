<h3>About NoVaLUG</h3>

<p id="return.open">The Northern Virginia Linux Users Group (NoVaLUG) is the oldest LUG in the Northern VA area and likely in the whole of US. Established 1993, the group's focus is on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" title="Consult Wikipedia for discussion of open source">open source</a> software with a primary area of interest being 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" title="Consult Wikipedia discussion of Linux">Linux</a>. NoVaLUG members meet monthly to socialize and learn from one-another, as well as from guest speakers. Attendees include a mix of IT professionals, hobbyists, students, and other interested individuals. Presentations are open for Q&amp;A. Topics of presentations include software use and development &mdash; a wide range of related topics, some esoteric, e.g., assembling and using a micro-computer (Raspberry Pi) to do aerial photography from a kite. Time us usually set aside at the end of meetings for attendees to discuss job opportunities for seekers as well as offerings by employers.

<p>This web page was developed and written with <em>open source</em> tools. Read
<a href="./#open" title="Jump to discussion of open source and this web page">more below</a> about this example of the use of open source software.

<h3><u>An Introduction to Linux</u></h3>
<p style="font-size:small;">We're going back to basics. For beginners and just curious - learn what makes Linux a great computer operating system, and how to get started with basic tasks.

Bring your questions about things you've wondered about, find new/better ways to do things you thought was hard to do and overall get this Linux thing de-mystified.</p>

<h3>What's with the Penguin?</h3>

<p>Tux, a penguin character, is the official brand character of the Linux kernel. Originally created as an entry to a Linux logo competition, Tux is the most commonly used icon for Linux, although different Linux distributions depict Tux in various styles. The character, also commonly called the Linux mascot, is used in many other Linux programs and as a general symbol of Linux. [Ref: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot)" title="Read about the official Linux mascot on Wikipedia.">Wikipedia</a>]
